## What is Laravel BoilerPlate

### Anar Bayramov 2018

Laravel boilerplate provides you many basic and advanced features to start a new project.
As each project requires different packages or libraries I tried to keep this one as simple as possible 

currently Laravel boilerplate 5.6 Included

* Laravel 5.6 
* Most used docker-containers with lots of dependencies (Credits and many thanks to [Laradock](https://github.com/laradock/laradock) as it is simplified version of laradock)  
* Local SSL and HTTPS using openssl
* [Spatie Laravel Permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission)
